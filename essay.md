## What Single cell data tells us about cancer evolution: a comprehensive review

**Abstract  
**Cancer is an evolving, adaptive ecosystem shaped by continuous genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental changes. Traditional bulk sequencing obscures this complexity by averaging signals across heterogeneous cell populations, masking rare but clinically significant subclones. Single-cell and spatial sequencing technologies have transformed our understanding of tumor evolution by enabling high-resolution profiling of individual cells and preserving their spatial context. These approaches have uncovered profound intra-tumor heterogeneity, phenotypic plasticity, and dynamic interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) that drive disease progression, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. Single-cell analyses reveal the trajectories of clonal evolution, identify minimal residual disease, and illuminate how cancer cells adapt under therapeutic pressure. Integrating multi-omics, spatial data, and artificial intelligence (AI) offers a pathway toward predictive, evolution-informed oncology. The establishment of longitudinal single-cell datasets and comprehensive cancer atlases promises to bridge the gap between bench and bedside, advancing precision medicine. As these technologies move closer to clinical translation, addressing computational, ethical, and data equity challenges will be essential to realizing their full potential in improving patient outcomes.

## Introduction

**Overview of Cancer Evolution:  
**Cancer is a dynamic evolutionary process driven by the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations within cells. These changes lead to increased cellular diversity, enabling tumors to adapt, survive, and progress in response to selective pressures such as the immune system, microenvironment, and therapy. Understanding cancer evolution helps explain tumor initiation, heterogeneity, metastasis, and resistance to treatment.

**Limits of Bulk Sequencing:**  
Traditional bulk sequencing analyzes DNA or RNA from millions of cells pooled together, providing an average profile that masks underlying cellular diversity. As a result, rare but clinically important subpopulations (such as drug-resistant clones) are obscured, making it challenging to fully understand intra-tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution, and the mechanisms of treatment failure.

**Rise of Single-Cell Technologies:**  
Single-cell sequencing technologies, such as scRNA-seq and scDNA-seq, emerged to overcome these limitations. They allow profiling of individual cells’ genomes, transcriptomes, or epigenetic landscapes, capturing the full extent of cellular variation in tumors. This granularity has revolutionized the study of cancer, revealing previously undetectable cell states, lineages, and microenvironmental interactions.

**Why Single-Cell Data Matters in Cancer Research:**  
Single-cell data uncovers the hidden complexity of tumors, providing insights into which cell populations drive progression, relapse, or resist therapy. It enables the identification of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets, tracks clonal evolution and lineage relationships, and informs personalized medicine strategies tailored to target the most problematic cells within each patient’s tumor.

## Single-Cell Technologies in Cancer Research

Single cell sequencing enables us to separately evaluate the subpopulation of cells in a cancerous tumour at the genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic level. This technology helps us understand tumours that exhibit varied morphological and phenotypic profiles. Additionally, SCS technologies also give us insights about cancer cell populations that contribute to treatment resistance, metastasis, and immune evasion. Over the course of years, this technology has rapidly advanced and has evolved multiple techniques, each of which have a specialized and unique purpose.

_Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq)  
_scRNA-seq profiles the transcriptome of individual cells, which enables one to assess the transcriptional similarities and differences between diseased and healthy cells within a cell population. scRNA helps us identify rare cell populations that otherwise go undetected in pooled analyses. After the isolation of single cells from the tissue of interest, the isolated individual cells are lysed to capture as many RNA molecules as possible. microfluidic droplets. Oligo(dT) primers are commonly used to capture the poly-A tail on messenger RNAs (mRNA) and avoid other RNA species such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The poly-T-primed mRNA molecules are converted to DNA using reverse transcription. During the reverse transcription step, the poly-T-primed mRNA will be attached to additional nucleotides such as adaptor sequences and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). After reverse transcription and cDNA amplification, sequencing libraries are prepared and sequenced on NGS platforms, allowing each transcript to be traced back to its cell of origin (Tang et al., 2019).

_Single-Cell DNA Sequencing (scDNA-seq)  
_scDNA-seq exhibit high sensitivity detection of somatic mutations and copy-number variations (CNVs) among individual cells within a cell population. It characterizes the genomic landscape of individual cells which gives us direct insight into the genetic heterogeneity and tumour evolution at the single-cell level. The drawback in this method is the low quantity of DNA per cell, which inhibits its use on commercially available sequencers. Therefore, an additional whole genome amplification (WGA) step must be included before the library preparation process. There are several methods to achieve WGA, but the most commonly employed methods are multiple displacement amplification (MDA) or multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC). (Hou et al., 2023).

## _Single-Cell ATAC Sequencing (scATAC-seq)  
_scATAC-seq assesses chromatin accessibility within individual cells. The technique uses the hyperactive Tn5 transposase enzyme loaded with sequencing adapters to insert tags into open chromatin regions. After PCR amplification and sequencing, the resulting reads indicate accessible genomic regions, which correspond to promoters, enhancers, and other regulatory elements (Buenrostro et al., 2015). scATAC-seq reveals epigenetic heterogeneity within tumors and the transcriptional circuits controlling malignant behavior. When integrated with scRNA-seq data, it connects chromatin accessibility with gene expression, providing insights into regulatory mechanisms driving cancer progression (Saldana-Miranda et al., 2024).

## _Spatial Transcriptomics  
_Spatial transcriptomics preserves the spatial organization of tissues while capturing gene expression information. Tissue sections are placed on slides containing spatially barcoded oligonucleotides. mRNA hybridizes in situ to these barcodes, allowing transcripts to be mapped back to their spatial coordinates after sequencing (Burgess, 2019). Other techniques, such as MERFISH and seqFISH, directly visualize transcripts within intact tissues. Spatial transcriptomics allows researchers to study how cellular organization influences tumor behavior. It provides insights into spatial gradients of hypoxia, immune infiltration, and tumor–stroma interactions, linking histological architecture with molecular features (Liu et al., 2024).

## _Single-Cell Multi-omics integration  
_Multi-omics technologies measure multiple molecular layers (DNA, RNA, proteins, or chromatin) from similar of different cells. Techniques such as CITE-seq (RNA + protein) and 10x Multiome (RNA + ATAC) use joint assay chemistries or split-cell workflows to capture multiple data types. Computational tools such as Seurat and MOFA+ integrate these layers to reveal coordinated molecular regulation (Argelaguet et al., 2020). Multi-omics integration links genotype to phenotype, showing how mutations influence chromatin structure and transcriptional output. This enables comprehensive modeling of tumor states and therapeutic vulnerabilities (Han et al., 2021).

_Lineage tracing and Trajectory interface:  
_Lineage tracing employs heritable barcodes (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 edits, mitochondrial mutations) to track descendant cell populations over time. When coupled with single-cell sequencing, these barcodes reveal clonal relationships. Computational trajectory inference uses transcriptomic similarities to reconstruct cellular differentiation paths and pseudotime progressions (Street et al., 2018).These methods illuminate tumor evolution, showing how cancer cells transition between states or acquire drug resistance. They have been instrumental in mapping tumor plasticity and identifying progenitor populations driving metastasis (Jia et al., 2020).

  
**Key Insights from Single-Cell Data**

**Subclonal Variation:**  
Single-cell technologies allow researchers to dissect tumors at the finest resolution, revealing that what once appeared to be a homogeneous mass actually consists of multiple, genetically distinct subclones. These subclonal populations can have unique mutations, copy number aberrations, and even chromosomal rearrangements. Such diversity within a tumor provides a substrate for rapid adaptation—certain subclones may be more aggressive or better able to resist treatment, ultimately fuelling disease progression and relapse.

**Phenotypic Plasticity:  
**Beyond genetic differences, single-cell RNA sequencing uncovers dramatic variability in gene expression profiles even among genetically similar cancer cells. This phenotypic plasticity means that cancer cells can switch identities, adopting different states—such as transitioning from a proliferative to a drug-tolerant phenotype—without needing new mutations. This flexibility complicates therapy, as cells can temporarily evade targeted drugs and later repopulate the tumor.

**Case Examples from Major Cancers:**  
Studies in cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia, breast, and lung cancers have demonstrated the power of single-cell analysis. For instance, in breast cancer, single-cell sequencing has identified rare stem-like cells that drive resistance to chemotherapy, while in glioblastoma, hundreds of unique expression programs and subclonal drivers have been mapped within single tumors. These insights are helping to design more precise and personalized therapies that take tumor heterogeneity into account.

## Clonal Evolution & Phylogenetic Reconstruction

**Early vs Late Mutations:**  
Single-cell genomics enables precise mapping of the order in which mutations arise during tumor development. Early (foundational) mutations are present in all or most tumor cells and typically set the stage for initial transformation. Late mutations appear only in subclones and often coincide with disease progression, therapy resistance, or metastasis. By distinguishing early from late events, researchers can prioritize actionable targets that will impact the broadest spectrum of tumor cells.

**Clonal Selection & Parallel Evolution:  
**Exposure to selective pressures (such as drug treatment or immune attack) can lead to the expansion of certain clones while others regress—a process known as clonal selection. Sometimes, different subclones independently acquire similar mutations, a phenomenon called parallel evolution, suggesting convergent solutions to common challenges in the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell phylogenetic methods reconstruct these evolutionary histories in detail, revealing how cancer adapts dynamically and highlighting the importance of combination therapies to preempt resistance.

**Tumor microenvironment (TME) evolution:  
**The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic ecology that has a significant impact on all stages of cancer development, from tumor initiation to metastasis and therapeutic resistance. Rather than a static scaffold, the TME is a dynamic network of cancer cells, immune infiltrates, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM) components that interact and co-evolve (Hanahan, 2022). These interactions are controlled by a complex interplay of biochemical signals, mechanical cues, and metabolic exchanges that balance tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive forces (Quail & Joyce, 2013). In this environment, immune cells such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells undergo functional reprogramming in response to tumor-derived cytokines, growth factors, and ion-mediated signaling pathways. This results in immune tolerance, T-cell exhaustion, and macrophage polarization toward pro-tumorigenic phenotypes, allowing cancer cells to avoid immune detection (Binnewies et al., 2018; Roma-Rodrigues et al., 2019).

Simultaneously, stromal elements such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and endothelial cells actively remodel the ECM, release immunomodulatory cytokines, and promote angiogenesis, creating a milieu conducive to tumor growth. CAFs, in particular, show extraordinary plasticity, adjusting to changing metabolic and mechanical conditions within tumors while maintaining immunosuppressive barriers (Tauriello & Batlle, 2016). The co-evolution of cancer and immune cells is fueled by ongoing selective pressures immune editing, metabolic competition, and hypoxia-induced signaling that favor the survival of more aggressive and immune-resistant cells. This evolutionary arms race creates a geographically and temporally diverse TME in which immune exclusion, fibrosis, and altered pH coexist inside the same tumor (Mantovani et al., 1992). TRP and ORAI ion channels play a role in regulating Ca⁺ flow, mechanical stress responses, and communication between stromal and immune cells. Together, these interrelated activities provide a robust tumor environment that can respond to treatment interventions. A better knowledge of how cancer, immunological, and stromal cells co-evolve inside the TME is critical for creating next-generation therapeutics that reprogramme the tumor niche, restore effective immune surveillance, and prevent recurrence(Mantovani et al., 1992; Quail & Joyce, 2013).

## Therapy Resistance & Minimal Residual Disease

**Single-cell tracking of resistant clones**  
Single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing technologies enable the identification and longitudinal tracking of rare, therapy-resistant clones within tumors. These resistant subpopulations, which may represent less than 1% of the tumor mass, can be pre-existing (adaptive resistance) or emerge during treatment (acquired resistance). By profiling individual cells before, during, and after therapy, researchers can detect genetic mutations, copy number alterations, and phenotypic shifts that confer survival advantages under drug pressure. This approach reveals whether resistance arises from selection of pre-existing clones or from new mutations induced by treatment, informing strategies to target these populations early and prevent relapse.​

**Epigenetic & transcriptional reprogramming**  
Cancer cells can escape therapy not only through genetic mutations but also via reversible epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming. Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq studies have shown that drug-tolerant persister cells undergo chromatin remodeling, enhancing plasticity and enabling them to adopt alternative transcriptional states that bypass drug action. For example, resistant melanoma and breast cancer cells display altered histone modifications and DNA methylation patterns that activate survival pathways and silence pro-apoptotic genes. These epigenetic changes can "lock in" transient resistant states, making them heritable and driving long-term treatment failure. Understanding these mechanisms offers opportunities to combine epigenetic drugs (e.g., EZH2 or DNMT inhibitors) with conventional therapies to prevent or reverse resistance.​

**Evolution under drug pressure**  
Chemotherapy and targeted therapies exert strong selective pressures that drive clonal evolution within tumors. Single-cell sequencing allows researchers to track how tumor cell populations shift over time in response to treatment, revealing patterns of clonal expansion, contraction, and diversification. Studies using single-cell barcoding and longitudinal monitoring have shown that some clones gain fitness advantages (proliferative or survival) while others acquire collateral sensitivities or fitness costs. By modeling these evolutionary dynamics, "evolutionary steering" strategies can be designed to exploit trade-offs—treating tumors in sequences that prevent or delay the emergence of fully resistant populations. This approach transforms our understanding of resistance from a static endpoint to a dynamic process that can potentially be controlled.​

  
**Computational and Analytical Challenges**

Despite the transformative insights single-cell technologies offer into cancer evolution, significant computational and analytical hurdles remain. The high dimensionality, sparsity, and noise inherent in single-cell datasets complicate efforts to accurately reconstruct tumour clonal architecture and infer evolutionary trajectories. For example, analyses moving from bulk sequencing to single-cell resolution must deal with new modelling frameworks and added uncertainty (Kuipers, 2017; Beerenwinkel et al., 2016; Lähnemann, D. et al. 2020).

Integrating diverse single-cell modalities, for instance transcriptomic, epigenomic, spatial requires advanced computational frameworks capable of handling multi-omics integration, batch correction, cross-platform normalisation, and harmonising disparate measurement scales. [](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-1926-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com)(Lähnemann, D. et al. 2020; Paas-Oliveros et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2020).

A key challenge lies in distinguishing true biological heterogeneity (e.g., rare subclones, minimal residual disease) from technical variability including drop-outs, amplification bias, dissociation artefacts, and batch effects (J. Fan, 2020). Another major hurdle is the scalability of analytical pipelines: as single-cell datasets grow in size (millions of cells, many patients, multi-timepoint sampling) the computational burden (memory, CPU/GPU, algorithmic complexity) increases, and reproducibility across platforms/cohorts becomes more difficult (Paas-Oliveros et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2020). Moreover, the development of robust evolutionary models that can integrate temporal, spatial and molecular dimensions of cancer progression remains an open problem. In the context of tumour evolution, modelling clonal dynamics, cell-state transitions, and microenvironmental interactions at single-cell resolution continues to pose serious methodological challenges (Kuipers et al., 2017; Beerenwinkel, N., et al., 2016).

Addressing these computational and analytical challenges is crucial for translating the single-cell insights into clinically actionable models of cancer evolution enabling improved precision diagnostics, therapeutic stratification, and prediction of relapse or metastasis.  

**Translation and Clinical Implications**

**Predicting tumor evolution and therapy response**

Predicting tumor evolution and treatment response is a major challenge in oncology due to cancer’s complexity and variability. The field is moving toward precision medicine, using molecular profiling, computational modeling, and continuous high-resolution monitoring to better predict and adapt to tumor changes (Abbas et al., 2025). Advanced imaging and data-driven algorithms enable short-term predictions of tumor behavior, supporting more individualized and timely treatment decisions. However, most current clinical monitoring remains rigid and standardized, often overlooking patient-specific variability. To address this, real-time adaptive protocols and simpler, clinically applicable models are needed (Karthiga et al., 2025). Predictive modeling, especially in radiotherapy, helps optimize therapy by balancing effectiveness and minimizing harm. Cancer Progression Models and adaptive strategies such as SMART (Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial) designs and evolutionary steering are being developed to anticipate resistance and tailor treatments dynamically, moving oncology toward proactive, personalized care (Diaz-Uriarte & Vasallo, 2019).

**Single-cell liquid biopsy applications**

Single-cell liquid biopsy technologies are transforming cancer detection and monitoring by enabling real-time, non-invasive analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free biomarkers. Unlike traditional tissue biopsies, they allow longitudinal tracking of tumor evolution, therapeutic resistance, and clonal dynamics (Keller & Pantel, 2019). Techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics have revealed molecular heterogeneity among CTCs, including variations in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, immune evasion, and metastatic potential (Xu et al., 2021). Clinically, single-cell profiling has refined treatment decisions—such as detecting HER2 heterogeneity in breast cancer or guiding EGFR-targeted therapy selection in lung cancer—demonstrating their value in precision oncology (Hao & Zheng, 2025).

Beyond plasma-based assays, single-cell analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides valuable insights into brain metastases and neurological cancers, helping distinguish true recurrence from treatment effects. These methods also advance research in immunology and infectious diseases by identifying immune signatures and cell-specific responses (Schafflick et al., 2020). Integrating single-cell profiling with microfluidic platforms further supports therapy monitoring and personalized treatment strategies.

**Personalized medicine guided by single-cell data**

Single-cell technologies are reshaping personalized medicine by offering high-resolution insights into cellular heterogeneity within tumors and other tissues (Keller & Pantel, 2019). Unlike bulk profiling, single-cell analyses reveal rare, clinically important subpopulations that drive drug resistance, immune evasion, and disease progression, supporting more precise, individualized therapy decisions (Hao & Zheng, 2025).

Integrating single-cell data with artificial intelligence enables predictive modeling of treatment effects and tumor evolution, supporting adaptive therapy and biomarker discovery. Beyond oncology, single-cell profiling is advancing fields like immunotherapy, regenerative medicine, and autoimmune disease research by illuminating intercellular communication and guiding targeted interventions (Chapelle et al., 2022). This approach marks a shift toward proactive, evolution-informed clinical care.

**Drug Resistance Monitoring in Real Time**

Real-time drug resistance monitoring involves continuously tracking tumor responses to treatment at the molecular and cellular levels, allowing for earlier detection of emerging resistance before it becomes clinically evident (Garg et al., 2024). Recent advances in imaging, molecular diagnostics, and computational modeling enable detailed observation of tumor evolution during therapy (Pulumati et al., 2023). Techniques such as multiparametric imaging, liquid biopsies (ctDNA analysis), and single-cell sequencing provide noninvasive, high-resolution insights into resistance mechanisms and tumor heterogeneity (Sabit et al., 2025). Integrating these data with artificial intelligence allows dynamic prediction and real-time adaptation of treatment strategies (Wang et al., 2025). This proactive, precision-guided approach enables clinicians to anticipate and address resistance early, shifting cancer care from reactive to anticipatory management and improving patient outcomes.

## Future Directions:

**Integration with AI and Spatial Temporal Models:**

The data generated by single-cell technologies is incredibly rich, but also overwhelmingly complex. To make sense of it all, we will need to lean heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These tools are becoming essential for finding the biological signals in the noise, helping us to more accurately identify cell types, map out their developmental paths, and even predict how cells communicate with each other within a tumor (Aibar, S., et al. 2017).

A major challenge, however, is that single-cell sequencing loses the spatial context of the cells -it tells us what the cells are, but not where they are located in the tumor.This is where spatial transcriptomics comes in.This exciting technology maps gene expression directly onto tissue slices, allowing us to see how a cell's location influences its behavior and how the tumor microenvironment shapes cancer's evolution (Ståhl, P. L., et al. 2016).The next frontier is to build "spatial-temporal" models that combine these layers of information.By integrating single-cell data from different time points with spatial maps, we can create dynamic simulations of a tumor's evolution.Such models could one day predict how specific cancer clones will respond to therapy in different parts of the tumor, helping us find weaknesses before they become a problem (Lähnemann, D., et al. 2020).

**Longitudinal Single-Cell Studies:**

To truly understand the process of evolution, it must be observed over time. Most current single-cell cancer studies are cross-sectional, providing a snapshot of a tumor at a single point in time (e.g., at diagnosis).A crucial next step is to conduct longitudinal studies, where we track a patient's cancer by analyzing samples at multiple points. For example, before treatment, after surgery, and if the cancer returns (Gao, R., et al. 2022).  
These studies are vital for seeing exactly how tumors adapt and develop resistance.By comparing the cellular makeup of a tumor before and after therapy, we can pinpoint the specific subclones that survive and cause a relapse. Researchers have already used this approach to uncover the cellular dynamics behind resistance to targeted therapies and chemotherapy (Kim, C., et al. 2018). By expanding this work across more cancer types, we can build an incredibly detailed, high-definition view of cancer evolution as it happens, paving the way for smarter, adaptive treatment strategies that stay one step ahead of the disease.

#### Creation of Single-Cell Cancer Atlases

#### Just as the Human Genome Project gave us a foundational reference for human genetics, we now need to create comprehensive atlases of cancer at the single-cell level. Large-scale, collaborative projects like the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) are already working to map the cellular landscape of cancers from their earliest stages to full-blown metastatic disease (Rozenblatt-Rosen, O., et al. 2020). These atlases will become an indispensable reference for the entire research community.

Imagine having a standardized map that allows scientists to compare tumors across different patients and cancer types. An atlas like this would help us identify common and unique cellular states, understand the composition of the tumor microenvironment, and find conserved molecular pathways that could be targeted with new therapies (Regev, A., et al. 2017). It would allow researchers to place their own findings into a much broader context, dramatically accelerating the pace of discovery.

#### Clinical Translation & Ethical Concerns

The ultimate promise of this research is to help patients. The path to the clinic is full of exciting possibilities but also significant hurdles. In the near future, analyzing circulating tumor cells from a simple blood test (a "liquid biopsy") could allow doctors to monitor a patient's cancer in real-time, spotting the emergence of resistant clones and adjusting treatment on the fly (Jordan, N. V., et al. 2016). Looking further ahead, single-cell profiling of a tumor biopsy could become a standard part of diagnosis, helping oncologists choose the most effective personalized treatment by revealing the specific vulnerabilities of a patient's cancer (Suva, M. L., & Tirosh, I. 2019).However, this exciting future comes with a host of ethical and practical challenges that we must address. The sheer amount of sensitive genomic data requires ironclad protections for patient privacy. The high cost and technical difficulty of these methods also mean we need to think carefully about data equity, ensuring that all patients can benefit from these advances, not just a select few. Furthermore, sequencing a tumor can sometimes reveal unexpected inherited genetic risks, raising complex questions about patient consent, whether to return those results, and how to provide proper genetic counseling (Beskow, L. M., et al. 2020). Tackling these ethical, legal, and social issues head-on will be absolutely essential to responsibly bringing the power of single-cell technologies into routine cancer care.

**Conclusion**

The tumor microenvironment is not a passive bystander but a dynamic co-architect of cancer evolution, shaping disease trajectory and treatment response. Advances in single-cell and spatial technologies have revealed unprecedented complexity in tumor–immune–stromal interactions, emphasizing the need to target ecosystems rather than isolated pathways. Future therapeutic success will rely on integrating multi-omics data with real-time TME profiling to design adaptive, patient-specific interventions. By redefining cancer as an evolving multicellular ecosystem, new avenues for early detection, immune reprogramming, and therapy resistance reversal are now within reach.
